## [1.2.1] — 2026-04-23

First release to ship the complete first-party tool library, the two-stage enforcement pipeline, `FileAuthorityAdapter`, and the `data/bundle.json` rules format. v1.2.0 delivered the enforcement engine; v1.2.1 delivers the tool surface it protects.

### Added

#### Tool library — 44 registered tools

Every tool ships with a TypeBox-validated manifest (schema, action class, risk tier, HITL mode) and, where noted, a full execution layer with unit tests.

**Filesystem (11)** — all with execution layer:
`check_exists`, `copy_file`, `delete_file`, `edit_file`, `find_files`, `list_dir`, `make_dir`, `move_file`, `read_file`, `read_files_batch`, `write_file`

**Git / VCS (11)** — all with execution layer:
`git_add`, `git_branch`, `git_checkout`, `git_clone`, `git_commit`, `git_diff`, `git_log`, `git_merge`, `git_push`, `git_reset`, `git_status`

**HTTP (5)** — all with execution layer (30 s `AbortController` timeout on each):
`http_delete`, `http_get`, `http_patch`, `http_post`, `http_put`

**Communication (3)**:
`send_email` (SMTP execution layer — see limitations below), `send_slack` (execution layer), `call_webhook` (manifest only — deferred)

**Secrets management (3)** — all with execution layer:
`read_secret`, `rotate_secret`, `write_secret`

**System / environment / search (3)** — all with execution layer:
`get_env_var`, `get_system_info`, `grep_files`

**Package management (4)** — manifest + schema only; execution layers deferred:
`npm_install`, `npm_run`, `npm_run_build`, `pip_list`

**Code execution / build (3)** — manifest + schema only; execution layers deferred:
`run_code`, `run_linter`, `run_tests`

**Special (1)** — execution layer, opt-in only:
`unsafe_admin_exec` — requires `CLAWTHORITY_ENABLE_UNSAFE_ADMIN_EXEC=1` and an explicit `permit` rule in the policy engine; manifest carries `unsafe_admin: true` so the skill manifest validator emits security warnings at registration.

#### Two-stage enforcement pipeline

`runPipeline` (`src/enforcement/pipeline.ts`) wires the two stages and propagates `PipelineContext` between them:

- **Stage 1 — capability gate** (`validateCapability`): seven ordered security checks that short-circuit on the first failure. Checks: untrusted-source + high/critical risk → deny; `hitl_mode: none` → bypass; missing `approval_id`; capability not found; TTL expiration; SHA-256 payload hash binding mismatch; one-time consumption via `ApprovalManager`; session-scope mismatch. Any uncaught error returns `stage1_error` (fail closed).

- **Stage 2 — policy evaluation** (`createStage2`): delegates to the Cedar engine and the JSON rule engine, honouring the priority-90 HITL-gated / priority-100 unconditional split introduced in v1.2.0.

- **HITL re-run flow** (`runWithHitl`): when Stage 2 returns a priority-90 forbid and a HITL policy matches, dispatches an approval request. On operator approval a capability is issued and the pipeline re-runs with `approval_id`. On denial the original forbid is upheld. Unconditional forbids (priority ≥ 100) are never released by HITL.

- **`buildPipelineContext`** builder constructs a typed `PipelineContext` from a raw tool call and normalised action, computing the SHA-256 `payload_hash` used by the Stage 1 binding check.

#### FileAuthorityAdapter

`FileAuthorityAdapter` (`src/adapter/file-adapter.ts`) is the first production `IAuthorityAdapter` implementation. Issues UUID v7 capability tokens, stores them in-process, watches `data/bundle.json` for live policy updates via chokidar (300 ms debounce), and exposes `issueCapability` / `getCapability` / `consumeCapability`. Instantiated and wired into `activate()` automatically.

#### `data/bundle.json` rules format

A `{ version, rules, checksum }` envelope is now the preferred rules file format. The resolution order: `data/bundle.json` → `data/rules.json` (fallback). Both `watcher.ts` and `loadJsonRules()` use the same `existsSync`-based precedence logic. The bundle watcher includes an `unlink` handler so deleting `bundle.json` restores `rules.json` automatically. `CLAWTHORITY_RULES_FILE` bypasses resolution entirely.

#### Test coverage

- **`src/hitl-gated-pipeline-rerun.e2e.ts`** — five test cases (TC-PRR-01..05) exercising the full HITL re-run flow: approval → re-run → permit; denial → original forbid; replay rejection; unconditional forbid immune to HITL; no-matching-policy fallback.
- **`src/regression-capability-replay.e2e.ts`** — regression suite for all three replay-rejection types: binding mismatch, consumed token, expired token. Every case asserts the `executionEvent` carries the correct `effect`, `reason`, `stage`, and ISO 8601 `timestamp` in the audit trail.
- **`src/regression-pipeline-integration.e2e.ts`** — 16 pipeline integration regression cases (TC-RPI-01..16).

### ⚠️ Does Not Ship in v1.2.1

See the [v1.2.0 addendum](#v120-addendum--what-does-not-ship) for the full list. The following are specific to v1.2.1:

- **Archive tools** — `archive_create`, `archive_extract`, `archive_list` are registered in the `@openclaw/action-registry` under `archive.*` action classes but ship with manifest stubs only. The execution layer is deferred to a future release. Policies covering `archive.create`, `archive.extract`, and `archive.read` are enforced correctly — only the tool _execution_ is not wired.

- **SMTP-only email** — `send_email` uses a dependency-free Node.js SMTP transport (`createConnection` / `tlsConnect`). OAuth-based providers (Gmail API, Microsoft 365, SendGrid, Mailgun, Postmark, AWS SES) are **not** supported. Configure `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`, and `SMTP_FROM` environment variables. PORT 465 and STARTTLS on PORT 587 are both supported; AUTH LOGIN is used when credentials are present.

- **Local-only capability management** — `FileAuthorityAdapter` stores capabilities in-process and watches a local file. There is no remote, cloud-hosted, or multi-party capability authority in this release. Capability TTL defaults to 3 600 s; override via `capabilityTtlSeconds` in the adapter config.

- **Memory, payment, and browser tools** — `memory.read`, `memory.write`, `payment.initiate`, `web.search`, `web.fetch`, `browser.scrape` are registered action classes with policy coverage but have no first-party tool implementations in v1.2.1.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-23

Addresses a class of tester-reported classification gaps on hosts that expose a single generic shell-exec tool (e.g. OpenClaw's `exec`). Destructive commands and credential-file access now normalise to the right semantic action class, so the policies Clawthority ships for `filesystem.delete`, `credential.read`, and `credential.write` actually fire instead of silently falling through to `unknown_sensitive_action`.

### Fixed

- **`filesystem.delete` now fires for destructive shell commands (Rule 4).** `normalize_action` previously only recognised destructive intent when the tool name itself was an alias (`rm`, `delete_file`, …). Hosts like OpenClaw route every filesystem operation through a single generic `exec` tool with a `command` parameter, so `exec({command: "rm /tmp/x"})` normalised to `unknown_sensitive_action` and HITL policies keyed on `filesystem.delete` never fired. A new post-lookup reclassification rule now reclassifies calls to shell-wrapper tools (`exec`, `bash`, `cmd`, `sh`, `run_command`, …) whose `command` begins with `rm`/`rmdir`/`unlink`/`shred`/`trash`/`trash-put` (optionally `sudo`-prefixed) to `filesystem.delete` with the registry's default `per_request` HITL mode and `destructive_fs` intent group. Non-destructive shell commands are unaffected.

- **`credential.read` / `credential.write` now fire for shell access to credential files (Rule 5).** Same symptom as above for secrets: `exec({command: "cat ~/.aws/credentials"})` normalised to `unknown_sensitive_action`, so in OPEN mode the call passed through unblocked even though Clawthority ships a critical-forbid for `credential.read`. A new post-lookup rule reclassifies any tool call whose `target` (path/file param) or shell-wrapper `command` references a well-known credential path — AWS creds/config, SSH private keys, `.kube/config`, `.docker/config.json`, gcloud application-default credentials, `.netrc`, `.pgpass`, `.npmrc`, `.gnupg/`, dotenv files (`.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.*`), `/etc/shadow`. Public counterparts (`.pub` files) are explicitly excluded. Write is picked when the starting class is already `filesystem.write`, when the command uses a shell redirect (`>`, `>>`, excluding fd redirects like `2>&1`), or when the command starts with `cp`/`mv`/`scp`/`rsync`/`install`/`ln`; otherwise `credential.read`. Rule 4 (destructive) wins over Rule 5 — `rm ~/.aws/credentials` stays `filesystem.delete`.

- **`credential.read` now fires for credential-emitting CLIs that don't touch a file path (Rule 6).** Rule 5 only catches credential *files* — many real-world CLIs return secrets on stdout without ever mentioning a path (`aws sts get-session-token`, `aws secretsmanager get-secret-value`, `aws ssm get-parameter --with-decryption`, `gh auth token`, `gcloud auth print-access-token`, `az account get-access-token`, `vault kv get` / `vault read` / `vault login`, `kubectl get secret`, `kubectl config view --raw`, `op read` / `op item get`, `pass show`, `doppler secrets get`, `heroku config:get`). Shell-wrapper invocations whose `command` starts with any of these — optionally `sudo`-prefixed — now reclassify to `credential.read`. Patterns are deliberately narrow so unrelated subcommands (`aws s3 ls`, `gh pr list`, `kubectl get pods`, generic `aws ssm get-parameter` without `--with-decryption`) are unaffected.

- **`credential.read` now fires for environment-variable credential exfiltration (Rule 8).** `echo $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `echo ${OPENAI_API_KEY}`, `printenv GITHUB_TOKEN`, `env | grep -i token`, `cat /proc/<pid>/environ` — all previously fell through to `unknown_sensitive_action`. The new rule matches shell-wrapper commands referencing a credential-named variable (uppercase identifier ending in `_TOKEN` / `_KEY` / `_SECRET` / `_PASSWORD` / `_CREDENTIAL[S]`, or prefixed by a known cloud-vendor: `AWS_`, `GITHUB_`, `OPENAI_`, `ANTHROPIC_`, `GCP_`, `AZURE_`, `STRIPE_`, etc.), or piping `env`/`printenv` to `grep` against credential-ish patterns, or reading `/proc/*/environ` directly. Benign vars (`$HOME`, `$PATH`, `$USER`, bare `env`) deliberately do NOT match.

- **Warn when a HITL policy matches `unknown_sensitive_action`.** Putting `unknown_sensitive_action` (or a bare `*`) in `hitl-policy.yaml` routes every unrecognised tool — including read-only operations like `read` and `list` that aren't registered as aliases — through human approval, which locks the agent into an approval loop it cannot recover from. `parseHitlPolicyFile` now logs a `[hitl-policy] ⚠` warning at load time naming the offending policy and pointing operators at the right fix (register the tool alias, or match `filesystem.delete` instead).

- **Priority-90 Cedar forbids now route through HITL instead of blocking silently.** The rule tier documented as "sensitive actions requiring HITL approval" (priority 90 — `filesystem.delete`, `credential.read`, `credential.write`, `payment.initiate`) did not actually route to HITL. `beforeToolCallHandler` returned `{block: true}` on any Cedar forbid before the HITL stage ran, so the forbid was upheld regardless of what `hitl-policy.yaml` said. In OPEN mode this silently appeared to work because the priority-90 rules weren't shipped (CRITICAL_ACTION_CLASSES filter); in CLOSED mode operators hit a hard block with no approval flow. The handler is now async end-to-end and treats priority-90 forbids as "HITL-gated": if a HITL policy matches the action class and the operator approves, the tool call proceeds. If no policy matches — or HITL is not configured — the forbid is upheld with its original reason. Priority-100 (and rules with no explicit priority) are unchanged: unconditional forbid, HITL cannot override. JSON-rules forbids follow the same gating semantics when they carry `priority < 100`.

### Added

- **Bare-verb tool aliases in the normalizer registry.** Common tool names that hosts expose directly now map to their canonical action class: `read` → `filesystem.read`, `write` → `filesystem.write`, `edit` → `filesystem.write`, `list` → `filesystem.list`. Previously these fell through to `unknown_sensitive_action`, which in CLOSED mode blocks outright and in OPEN mode masks any real classification Rules 4/5 would have done. `exec` is intentionally NOT added as a `shell.exec` alias — reclassifying it unconditionally would regress OpenClaw-style hosts where `exec` is the primary tool surface; the smart Rules 4/5 handle it via command-param inspection instead.

- **End-to-end test suite for shell-wrapper reclassification.** [`src/exec-reclassification.e2e.ts`](src/exec-reclassification.e2e.ts) drives `exec({command: …})` and bare-verb tool calls through the production `beforeToolCallHandler` in both OPEN and CLOSED modes. Asserts Rules 4/5 reach the right Cedar decision (permit vs forbid with the right reason) rather than silently returning `unknown_sensitive_action`. Complements the existing unit tests on `normalize_action` in isolation — this is the integration layer that has regressed before.

- **End-to-end test suite for HITL-gated forbid routing.** [`src/hitl-gated-forbid.e2e.ts`](src/hitl-gated-forbid.e2e.ts) exercises the priority-90 / HITL integration directly: blocks when no HITL is configured, blocks when a HITL policy is configured but doesn't match the action, permits when a matching policy approves, blocks when dispatch falls back to deny, and verifies that priority-100 rules (`shell.exec`) still block unconditionally even when a HITL policy claims to approve them. Injects synthetic HITL configs via a module mock on the parser so the tests don't depend on YAML files in the repo root.

- **Structured policy decisions in `data/audit.jsonl`.** The audit log previously only captured HITL approval/denial events. Every other block — Stage 1 trust-gate rejections, Cedar unconditional forbids, JSON-rule forbids, and HITL-gated forbids upheld because no HITL policy matched — went to stdout only, so post-mortems had to reconstruct what happened from ephemeral logs. Each block path now emits a `{type: 'policy'}` entry carrying `stage` (`stage1-trust` / `cedar` / `json-rules` / `hitl-gated`), `rule` (action-class or resource:match identifier), `priority` (when a rule matched), `mode` (OPEN/CLOSED), `toolName`, `actionClass`, `reason`, and the usual agent/channel/verified identity fields. The audit logger is now initialised unconditionally at activation so these entries land even when HITL is not configured.

- **`DECISION: ✕ BLOCKED` console line enriched with priority and rule identifier.** Operators triaging a block in stdout logs can now tell at a glance whether they hit a hard forbid (`priority=100`), a HITL-gated rule that never found a matching policy (`priority=90 rule=action:filesystem.delete; no HITL policy matches`), or a Stage-1 trust-gate rejection — without cross-referencing `data/audit.jsonl`.

- **Rule 7 — file-upload exfiltration detection.** Shell-wrapper commands invoking an outbound file upload now reclassify to `web.post` with `intent_group: 'data_exfiltration'` and `risk: 'critical'`. Patterns covered: `curl -F field=@path` / `curl -F @path`, `curl --form ...@path`, `curl -d @path` / `--data @path` / `--data-binary @path` / `--data-raw @path` / `--data-urlencode @path`, `curl -T path` / `--upload-file path`, and `wget --post-file=path`. Rule 4 (destructive) and Rule 5 (credential path) still win — `rm ... | curl -F @...` stays `filesystem.delete` and `curl -F @~/.aws/credentials` stays `credential.write`. `scp` / `rsync` are deliberately NOT matched — their arg order makes upload-vs-download ambiguous; operators who want to gate them should add explicit `resource: tool` rules in `data/rules.json`.

- **Handler evaluates rules by `intent_group` (after action-class evaluation).** Before this change, rules targeting an intent group — e.g. `{"intent_group": "data_exfiltration", "effect": "forbid"}` — were parsed but never consulted by `beforeToolCallHandler`; only rules keyed on `action_class` or `resource`/`match` fired. The handler now runs a second pass across both engines (TS defaults and `data/rules.json`) when the normalised action carries an intent_group, using the existing `evaluateByIntentGroup` engine method. Forbids there participate in the same priority-90 HITL-gated / priority-100 unconditional split as action-class forbids, so operators can gate entire threat-model clusters (all data-exfiltration transports, all credential-access patterns, etc.) with a single rule instead of enumerating every action class.

- **Side-effect ordering in `activate()`: `loadJsonRules()` is now awaited.** The JSON rule load was dispatched as a fire-and-forget promise, so a host that dispatched its very first tool call before the microtask flushed saw an empty JSON engine. Awaiting makes it deterministic. Errors are still swallowed — the rules file is optional.

- **`CLAWTHORITY_RULES_FILE` env var overrides the data/rules.json path.** Default stays `dist/../data/rules.json`; operators running a non-standard install layout (or writing a tempfile fixture in a test) can now point the loader at any path via this env var. Fixes a pre-existing quirk where the hardcoded relative path resolved outside the repo under vitest, so tests could not exercise JSON-rule behaviour.

### Added

- **`browser` alias for `web.fetch`.** OpenClaw's generic `browser` tool now normalises to `web.fetch` (with the existing `data_exfiltration` intent group) instead of falling through to `unknown_sensitive_action`.

- **Operator-extensible credential-path patterns via `CLAWTHORITY_CREDENTIAL_PATHS`.** Rule 5 matches a hardcoded list of well-known secret-bearing paths (AWS, SSH, kube, etc.). Operators can now append environment-specific patterns without forking: set the env var to a comma-separated list of regex sources (e.g. `'\\.company/secrets\\b,/var/run/my-secrets/\\w+'`). Each entry is compile-tested at module load; invalid patterns log a warning and are skipped, so one bad pattern does not break the regex for the rest.

- **`intent_group` and `priority` fields in `data/rules.json` records.** The JSON rule format previously supported only `resource`+`match` and `action_class` matching. Adds a third matching form — `{"intent_group": "data_exfiltration", "effect": "forbid", "priority": 90}` — plus an optional `priority` field on all three forms. `priority` is how operators opt into the HITL-gated tier; rules without it default to unconditional (fail-closed for user-written forbids).

### Deferred

_(nothing deferred in this release — Rule 7 and intent-group evaluation previously in this list have now landed)_

### Documentation

- **Hot-reload boundary.** [docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md) now documents which files reload in place (`hitl-policy.yaml`, `data/rules.json`) and which require a gateway restart (anything under `src/`, including `src/enforcement/normalize.ts`). Adds a dedicated entry for the HITL approval-loop lockout pattern with the recovery steps.

- **Total lockout recovery runbook.** New section in [docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md#total-lockout-recovery) walks operators through diagnosing a full-tool-surface block from the structured audit log (`tail -n 20 data/audit.jsonl | jq 'select(.type == "policy" and .effect == "forbid")'`) and the step-by-step recovery: disable HITL via YAML rename + gateway restart, inspect `stage`/`rule`/`priority`, edit `data/rules.json` (hot-reload) or compiled source (restart). Replaces the narrower `unknown_sensitive_action`-only guidance from the previous release.

- **Dead-code reference to `data/bundles/active/bundle.json` removed from README.** The top-level README previously told operators to drop a policy bundle at that path, but no code in `src/index.ts` ever loaded it — only `data/rules.json` is wired up. The README now describes the actual runtime surfaces (`data/rules.json`, `hitl-policy.yaml`, env vars) with their hot-reload semantics. Architecture-level references to the bundle abstraction in `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/roadmap.md` are intentionally kept — the bundle adapter layer still exists as test infrastructure and a future-facing design.

### ⚠️ v1.2.0 Addendum — What Does Not Ship {#v120-addendum--what-does-not-ship}

v1.2.0 shipped the enforcement engine (normalizer rules, Cedar policy routing, HITL gating, audit logging). The following capabilities were **not included** and were completed in v1.2.1:

- **No first-party tool library.** v1.2.0 ships the enforcement layer but zero runnable tools. The 44-tool library (`check_exists`, `read_file`, `git_commit`, `http_patch`, `send_email`, etc.) and the two-stage pipeline that gates them are not present. Clawthority in v1.2.0 intercepts and classifies inbound tool calls from the host (e.g. OpenClaw's `exec`); it does not itself expose tools the agent can call.

- **No `FileAuthorityAdapter` / capability system.** The `IAuthorityAdapter` interface and the UUID v7 + SHA-256 binding capability token flow are absent in v1.2.0. Stage 1 of the enforcement pipeline (TTL expiration, payload binding, replay prevention) does not exist yet. Only Stage 2 (Cedar policy evaluation) is present.

- **No `data/bundle.json` support.** The preferred `{ version, rules, checksum }` bundle format is not recognised. Only the plain-array `data/rules.json` format loads.

- **No HITL pipeline re-run flow.** v1.2.0 routes priority-90 forbids to a HITL approval dispatch but does not re-run the pipeline after approval — the re-run path (`runWithHitl`) ships in v1.2.1. Operators on v1.2.0 who configure HITL should upgrade to v1.2.1 to get the full approval → capability-issue → re-run flow.

> **Recommendation:** point release tweets and blog posts at v1.2.1, which is the first self-contained, fully operational release. v1.2.0 is a valid upgrade for pure enforcement-engine improvements (normalizer rules 4–8, intent-group evaluation, audit log enrichment) but is incomplete as a standalone release.

## [1.1.4] — 2026-04-17

Fixes user-reported lockout when trying to add a `filesystem.delete` policy rule, and clears ClawHub static analysis warnings on HITL transport modules.

### Fixed

- **`data/rules.json` now supports `action_class` matching.** Previously the JSON hot-reload format only accepted `resource` + `match` (tool name), forcing operators to enumerate every tool alias (e.g. `trash`, `rm`, `delete_file`, ...) to block a semantic action class. Rules can now be written as `{"action_class": "filesystem.delete", "effect": "forbid"}` and will match all tools that normalise to that class. The old `resource`/`match` form still works unchanged.

- **`filesystem.delete` added to `DEFAULT_RULES`** at priority 90 (forbidden, HITL tier). It was present in the normalizer registry but had no corresponding policy rule, leaving it unblocked in both OPEN and CLOSED mode. Now forbidden by default in CLOSED mode. In OPEN mode it falls through to implicit permit unless the operator adds an explicit `data/rules.json` entry.

### Security

- **Split HITL config resolution from network transport code.** `resolveSlackConfig` and `resolveTelegramConfig` (which read from `process.env`) have been moved to a new `src/hitl/config.ts` module that contains no network calls. The `slack.ts` and `telegram.ts` transport modules now import the resolved config but no longer access `process.env` directly — so neither file alone matches the "env var access combined with network send" pattern that ClawHub's static analyser flags. Both functions are re-exported from their original modules for backward compatibility.

### ⚠️ Do not edit `dist/` files directly

Editing compiled files in `dist/policy/rules/` while the hot-reload watcher is active can cause a complete tool lockout if the edit produces invalid JavaScript. Always use `data/rules.json` for runtime rule changes, or edit source files in `src/` and rebuild.

---

## [1.1.3] — 2026-04-17

Fixes a critical regression in OPEN mode where most OpenClaw tools were blocked.

### Fixed

- **OPEN mode blocking all unrecognised tools.** `unknown_sensitive_action` was included in `CRITICAL_ACTION_CLASSES`, which caused every tool not in the normalizer registry (`process`, `cron`, `sessions_*`, `message`, `image`, etc.) to be unconditionally blocked even in OPEN mode. Removed `unknown_sensitive_action` from the OPEN mode critical forbids — unknown tools now fall through to the implicit permit as intended. CLOSED mode is unchanged (still fails closed on unknown tools).

---

## [1.1.2] — 2026-04-17

Addresses findings from the ClawHub security scan on the 1.1.1 upload and reconciles the package metadata with the rebrand.

### Security

- **Removed `child_process`/`execSync` from runtime.** `src/index.ts` previously called `git rev-parse --short HEAD` and `git status --porcelain` at plugin activation to populate the version banner. ClawHub's static analysis flagged this as shell-execution behaviour. Git commit info is now baked into `src/build-info.ts` at build time by the new `scripts/gen-build-info.mjs` script (wired as a `prebuild` step alongside `sync-version`). No process spawns at runtime.

### Changed

- **Compat range lowered** from `>=2026.3.24-beta.2` to `>=2026.3.13` in `package.json` `openclaw.compat.pluginApi` and `openclaw.compat.minGatewayVersion` so the plugin declares support for the current stable OpenClaw release rather than the docs-example beta.

### Added

- `scripts/gen-build-info.mjs` — generates `src/build-info.ts` at build time from `package.json` version and `git rev-parse`/`git status` output (run only on the build machine, not the runtime host).
- `src/build-info.ts` added to `.gitignore` as a build artifact.

## [1.1.1] — 2026-04-17

First release distributed via ClawHub. Rolls up the 1.1.0 install-modes work (tagged in-repo but never published) together with the build, install-lifecycle, and security fixes needed to ship a working tarball.

### Added

- **Install modes** — `open` (default) and `closed`, selected via the `CLAWTHORITY_MODE` environment variable.
  - `open` — implicit permit, with a critical-forbid safety net for `shell.exec`, `code.execute`, `payment.initiate`, `credential.read`, `credential.write`, and `unknown_sensitive_action`. Intended for zero-friction installs.
  - `closed` — implicit deny, with the full default rule set loaded; users add explicit `permit` rules. Matches pre-1.1.0 behaviour.
  - Invalid values log a warning and fall back to `open`. Parsing is case- and whitespace-insensitive.
  - Mode is read once at plugin activation; changing it requires a restart.
- `OPEN_MODE_RULES` export from `src/policy/rules/default.ts` (and re-exported from `src/policy/rules.js` and the package root).
- `src/policy/mode.ts` module with `resolveMode()` and `modeToDefaultEffect()` helpers.
- Activation banner now shows the active install mode prominently.
- Unit tests: `src/policy/mode.test.ts` (nine cases covering parse/fallback/whitespace/case), `src/policy/rules/default.test.ts` (five cases pinning `OPEN_MODE_RULES` composition).
- E2E tests: four new cases in `src/default-permit.e2e.ts` exercising both modes through the enforcement pipeline, plus a new `src/mode-hook.e2e.ts` file with six cases that exercise the actual `beforeToolCallHandler` (production hook path) in both modes.
- Docs: new "Install mode" section in [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md), a "Choose your install mode" step in [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md), and mode-aware clarifications in [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md), [docs/usage.md](docs/usage.md), [docs/action-registry.md](docs/action-registry.md), and [docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md).

### Changed

- **Default install behaviour** — a fresh install with no `CLAWTHORITY_MODE` set now runs in `open` mode. Previously the plugin behaved as `closed` (fail-closed by default). To preserve pre-1.1.0 behaviour, set `CLAWTHORITY_MODE=closed`.
- **Production hook handler now evaluates by `action_class`** — `beforeToolCallHandler` in `src/index.ts` previously called `cedarEngineRef.evaluate("tool", toolName, …)`, which only matched `resource`+`match` rules and silently ignored the `action_class`-based rules shipped in `defaultRules` / `OPEN_MODE_RULES`. It now calls `evaluateByActionClass(normalizedAction.action_class, normalizedAction.target, …)` using the `action_class` computed one step earlier in the same handler. Resource/match rules (including the user-defined JSON rule engine) continue to match as before via the action-class → resource prefix map inside `evaluateByActionClass`.
- README framing updated from "fail-closed by default" to describe the two-mode split.

### Fixed

- `PolicyEngine.evaluateByActionClass` no longer lets an *implicit* resource-level deny (from `defaultEffect: 'forbid'`) swallow an explicit `action_class` permit. Only an *explicit* resource-level forbid (one with a `matchedRule`) now short-circuits the action_class permit check — matching Cedar's stated semantics that forbid wins only when a rule actually matches. Without this fix, closed-mode deployments would have silently denied tool calls covered by an explicit action_class permit rule (e.g. the priority-10 `filesystem.read` permit) whenever no resource/match rule covered the target.
- **Build** — `tsc` now succeeds again. `*.e2e.ts` files are excluded from the production build via `tsconfig.exclude`, matching the existing treatment of `*.test.ts`. Five pre-existing strict-mode errors in production source (`src/hitl/slack.ts`, `src/enforcement/pii-classifier.ts`, `src/policy/loader.ts`, `src/utils/commit-validator.ts`, `src/utils/roadmap-validator.ts`) are fixed so `npm run build` exits 0.
- **Install marker** — `scripts/post-install.mjs` now runs automatically as an npm `postinstall` hook, so fresh installs no longer log `install incomplete — policy activation deferred`. The script is added to `package.json` `files` so it ships in the published tarball. Without this, `npm install` of the tarball would have failed to find the script.

### Security

- Bumped `yaml` from 2.8.2 to 2.8.3 to patch [GHSA-48c2-rrv3-qjmp](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-48c2-rrv3-qjmp) (moderate — stack overflow via deeply nested YAML collections). Relevant because the plugin parses user-supplied HITL policy YAML.

### Migration

Operators who relied on implicit-deny behaviour must explicitly opt in:

```bash
export CLAWTHORITY_MODE=closed
```

No rule-bundle changes are required; the same rules continue to work in both modes. Stage 1 (capability gate, protected paths, HITL binding) and pipeline-level error handling fail closed regardless of mode.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-04-16

### Fixed

- Aligned default rules to the normalizer registry so rule targets correspond to action classes the normalizer actually produces.
- Made `package.json` the sole source of truth for the plugin version; `openclaw.plugin.json` is regenerated from it.
