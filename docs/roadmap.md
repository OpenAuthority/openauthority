# Roadmap

This document tracks what OpenAuthority has shipped, what is in progress, and what comes next. It is updated as work is completed.

## Shipped

These features are built, tested, and working in the current codebase.

### Cedar-Style Policy Engine
- Forbid-wins semantics (explicit forbid overrides any permit)
- Pattern matching: exact string, wildcard (`*`), RegExp
- Conditional rules with arbitrary functions (channel, agentId, etc.)
- Rate limiting with per-rule, per-caller sliding windows
- Hot-reload: edit rules, save, new rules active in ~300ms
- 24 default rules across 5 resource types (tool, command, channel, prompt, model)
- Rule merging (agent-specific + default rules)

### ABAC Policy Engine
- TypeBox-validated structured policies
- 8 condition operators (eq, neq, in, nin, contains, startsWith, regex)
- Dot-notation field path traversal for nested context
- Priority-ordered rule evaluation
- Configurable default effect per policy

### Gateway Hook Integration
- `before_tool_call` — primary enforcement hook, registered and active
- `before_prompt_build` — prompt injection detection (10 regex patterns), implemented but currently disabled
- `before_model_resolve` — model routing, implemented but currently disabled (waiting for OpenClaw to pass model name in event payload)
- Plugin interface with `activate()` / `deactivate()` lifecycle
- Activation guard for idempotent multi-registry registration

### Audit Logging
- Console audit handler
- JSONL file audit handler
- Multiple simultaneous sinks
- Custom handler support
- PolicyDecisionEntry schema with structured fields

### HITL Framework (built, integration pending)
- TypeBox-validated policy schema (HitlPolicyConfig, HitlPolicy, HitlApprovalConfig)
- Action pattern matcher with dot-notation wildcards (13 test cases)
- JSON and YAML policy file parser with schema validation
- Hot-reload watcher for HITL policy files (debounced, atomic swap)
- Comprehensive test suite (53+ test cases across matcher, validator, parser, watcher)
- **Not yet wired into `before_tool_call`** — the framework is ready, the hook integration is next

### UI Dashboard
- Express server with REST API
- React 18 + Vite SPA
- Rules management (CRUD with persistence to JSON file)
- Audit log viewer with pagination
- Live audit streaming via SSE
- Policy coverage map visualization

### ClawHub Skills
- `/budget` — token usage tracking, spend estimation, threshold alerts
- `/whatdidyoudo` — action replay, plain-language tool call log
- `/approve` — soft human-in-the-loop approval gate for interactive sessions

### Hot Reload
- Mutable engine reference pattern (atomic swap)
- ESM cache busting with timestamp query parameters
- Debounced file watcher (chokidar, 300ms)
- Error isolation (previous engine preserved on reload failure)
- Separate watchers for TypeScript rules, JSON rules, and HITL policies

## In Progress

### HITL Hook Integration
Wire the HITL matcher into `before_tool_call` so that actions matching a HITL policy pause execution and route to the approval flow.

**What exists:** The `checkAction()` function, policy parser, and watcher are built and tested.

**What's needed:**
- Load HITL policy file during plugin `activate()`
- Call `checkAction()` inside `beforeToolCallHandler` before Cedar/ABAC evaluation
- When `requiresApproval` is true, return a structured response that triggers the approval flow
- Define the approval request/response protocol

### Implicit Permit → Configurable Default
The Cedar engine currently returns implicit **permit** when no rule matches (line 192 of `src/policy/engine.ts`). This is a permissive default. The roadmap includes making this configurable:

- **Option A: Implicit deny** — no matching rule = denied. Stricter, requires explicit permits for everything. Better for locked-down production environments.
- **Option B: Implicit permit** — no matching rule = allowed. Current behaviour. Easier to adopt incrementally.
- **Option C: Configurable** — constructor option `defaultEffect: 'permit' | 'forbid'` lets the deployer choose.

Option C is the target. The engine constructor will accept a `defaultEffect` parameter, defaulting to `permit` for backwards compatibility while allowing security-conscious deployments to switch to `forbid`.

## Next Up

### Telegram Approval Adapter
Build the messaging bridge for HITL `ask-user` decisions:
- Telegram bot that sends approval requests with action details
- Approve/reject via reply or inline buttons
- Timeout handling (configurable per-policy)
- Fallback behaviour (deny or auto-approve on timeout)
- Message formatting with action name, arguments, agent context

### Structured Decision Object
Enrich the policy engine response beyond boolean permit/forbid:
```typescript
interface Decision {
  outcome: 'permit' | 'forbid' | 'ask-user'
  ruleId?: string           // for audit traceability
  capability?: {            // for credential injection
    id: string
    expiresAt: number
    scope: string[]
  }
}
```
This replaces the current `EvaluationDecision` with a richer type that carries provenance data through the pipeline.

### Re-enable `before_prompt_build` and `before_model_resolve`
Both hooks are implemented but disabled. Re-enable when:
- `before_prompt_build`: after verifying it doesn't cause false positives on normal prompts
- `before_model_resolve`: after OpenClaw passes the model name (not just prompt text) in the event payload

### Capability Registration
Register OpenAuthority as an OpenClaw capability provider via `api.registerProvider('policy', ...)` for full hook coverage across all tool execution paths, not just the legacy hook runner.

## Future

### Additional Approval Channels
- **Slack** — approve/reject via message buttons
- **Web dashboard** — approve/reject from the OpenAuthority UI with pending action queue
- **Webhook** — POST to any HTTP endpoint, await callback
- **Email** — approval via email reply (for compliance workflows)

### Control Plane API
The `control-plane-api/` scaffold exists. Full implementation includes:
- Multi-tenant policy management
- Database-backed policy storage with migrations
- User and tenant management
- REST API for programmatic policy CRUD
- Centralised audit log aggregation across agents

### ClawHub Skill Publishing
Publish the three skills (`budget`, `whatdidyoudo`, `approve`) to ClawHub as the official OpenAuthority skill pack. Each skill is a soft-enforcement layer that drives adoption of the plugin.

### Policy Language Evolution
- Cedar policy file format (`.cedar` files) alongside TypeScript rules
- YAML policy files for non-developer users
- Policy validation CLI tool
- Policy diff and dry-run before applying changes

### Observability
- Prometheus/OpenTelemetry metrics export (decisions/sec, block rate, latency)
- Grafana dashboard template
- Alerting on anomalous block rates or rate limit saturation
